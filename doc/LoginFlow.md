## Login flow
If everything is properly configured login flow will be as on figures below. First click on `Login` link that by default is in top right corner of your web browser. This will redirect you to the login pane. Click on "Login to Auth0" button.

This will redirect to the second login pane, but this time it's on 'Auth0' platform (see web browser url). From this place you can select external Identity Provider (in this example 'Google') or sign in directly to the Auth0.

At the end you will be redirected to the DNN website as signed-in user. For first time, user will be automatically created in DNN. User profile is created, but your password isn't saved in DNN.
